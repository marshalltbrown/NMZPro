##General Window Setup: 

• There must be no widgets (other than absorption pots remaining) in the top left corner.

• Potion buff info must be in the bottom left
    
• Under Runelite "Boosts Information", turn on "Use Relative Boosts"

• Turn ammo plugin off. It obstructs the buff timer.

Your setup in general should look like this:
